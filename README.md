Cognitive Games - Capstone Project

Introduction

This repository contains the final project for the Computational Thinking for Engineering course. Our project is a cognitive game designed to help users improve their learning and cognitive skills through gameplay. The primary objective of the project is to create a game from scratch that trains the brain while also providing an engaging and fun experience.

Game Overview

The game we have developed is inspired by Wordle, a word-guessing game where users must guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. This dynamic game encourages users to engage in critical thinking and pattern recognition, making it both enjoyable and intellectually stimulating.

Rules of the Game

The player receives a word with a specific number of letters.

The player has 5 attempts to guess the correct word.

After each guess, feedback is provided to the player:

Green: The letter is correct and in the right position.

Yellow: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.

Red: The letter is incorrect.

If the player guesses the word within 5 attempts, points are awarded based on the number of attempts used:

1 attempt: 100 points

2 attempts: 80 points

3 attempts: 70 points

4 attempts: 50 points

5 attempts: 45 points

If the player fails to guess the word within 5 attempts, they lose, and the correct word is revealed.
